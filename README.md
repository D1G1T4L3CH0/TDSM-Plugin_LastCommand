# LastCommand
This is a [TDSM](https://github.com/DeathCradle/Terraria-s-Dedicated-Server-Mod) plugin.  
Executes the last command you entered either from console or in game.

## Installation
You only need to copy the lcmd.cs file to your Plugins directory and load it with the `plugin load lcmd.cs` command.

## Usage
Assuming you've typed at least one other command first, just type `/!` in game or `!` in console to repeat the last command you sent.
